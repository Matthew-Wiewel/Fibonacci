This repository has code for a simple program that will allow calculation of fibonacci numbers larger than able to be held by built-in datatypes. To do that I created a class called MyInt that contains an array of short integers where each index of the array represents a digit in the overall number. By doing this, I was able to greatly expand the range of numbers able to be calculated. As the intended use of this class at this time was for this program with fibonacci numbers, some of the functionality of the class is very basic as addition assumes two positive numbers with the same array size as it stands right now and there is no multiplication/division/subtraction. Nor would adding a positive number to a negative one be supported in its current state. However, it is able to successfully hold large numbers.

To calculate the fibonacci number, I originally decided to do it in an iterative way, using a for loop. However I later decided to do it recursively. This decision was based on a desire to get some personal practice with memoization in C++.
